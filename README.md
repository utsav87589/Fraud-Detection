# Fraud-Detection
Fraud detection dataset, I am gonna do FE+EDA + Predictions for this dataset alongside the unsupervised ML and also the ANN will come into the picture for the predictions later on

### day 1 update

-setting up the files and loading the dataset to make sure everything is setup good
-obeserving the dataset by loading it using python and planning how I am gonna aprroach that dataset

### day 2 update

-finished all the categorical columns, numericals are the next
-the data is good and balanced pretty good actually

### day 3 update

-finished all the numeric columns
-dataset is well balanced and less of a challeneg already

### day 4 update

-fixed the borken python environment
-made the prepration for the further data cleaning that includes the normalization for the distance based algos

### day 5 update

-made the two different datasets for the tree and distance based algos, alongside the seprate file for categorical and numerical columns
-made the algorithm file and loaded the data with the train test split for tree based and distance based algos

### day 6 update

-predictions for the probablity and distance based algos done, 
-tree based algos made perfect prediction, I made a few investigations for the data leakage to figure that out
-so, tomorrow I will drop two features(failed, transaction_7d and risk_score) for the tree based algos only to confiem the leak

### day 7 update

-identified the data leak for the algorithms and further testings willbe done
-initial predictions for the dataset with keeping both the columns is done alongside the ANN and other algos
